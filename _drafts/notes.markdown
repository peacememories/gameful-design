# What makes a game?

Pick any:

* The magic circle/Escapism (????)
* Challenge
* Entertainment (????)
* Uniqueness/Intrigue (Unique Mechanics, Artstyle, etc.)
* Educating ([tangential learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQrTHrwyxQ))
* Changing Perspective ([careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP4_bMhZ4gA))

# Additions

* Magic Circle and conflicts with AR, etc.

    Definition of the magic circle in Fundamentals of Game Design does not show this conflict
    Definition (butchered quote here):
    > A space of agreement about rules for, and values of objects and situations in the context of the game

* Conflict as basis of games

    The definition becomes very weak when applied to games like `Gone Home`
